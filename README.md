# Suport-Vector-Machine
A Support Vector Machine is a supervised algorithm that can classify cases by finding a separator. SVM works by first, mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space so that data points can be categorized,In this notebook we use SVM (Support Vector Machines) to build and train a model using bank records, and classify bill authorisation to whether.SVM works by mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space so that data points can be categorized, even when the data are not otherwise linearly separable.
